Project Schema Design

Assumption:
	a patient can have only one account. If he wants to reserve multiple appointments for others, he can not do that. Each person needs to register as an individual patient, and each time 1 patient can only receive 1 same appointment offer at the same time slot (the same provider can't offer two vaccine to one patient).
